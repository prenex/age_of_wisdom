# Age of Empires I: Age Of Wisdom
Tricky age of empires I expansion campaigns - all maps are playable as multiplayer scenarios!

Requirements
============

These maps and campaigns are made with the Rise of Rome expansion so you need the expansion in order to play these.

Gameplay
========

In short: More advanture and storytelling than strategy - while staying true to the simplicity Age of Empires I offers.

The gameplay mostly revolve around really tricky uses of priests and micro-management tactics. Made together for those who enjoyed the the first "holy man" chapter of the "Voices of babylon" champaign of the original Age of Empires - and actually for those who always like to play in the way of enjoying the depth and feeling of the game to the most.

As being said, the campaing is well enjoyable in single player, but all maps are designed to be playable in a multiplayer setup! Most maps support two players, but some of them support even more. All players that you can choose start differently and have a very-very different environment, background story, feeling to it. I always felt sad not being able to feel a campaign-like feeling when playing with friends so the maps are trying to fill-in these gaps!

After enough testing multiplayer balance can be achieved even if you are not mirroring the situation of your opponents in symmetry. The older the map and more I have been working on them are more balanced of course. Some are better, some are less great in balance, but still I feel it worth it!

Comments and reviews are really welcome. Hopefully you can get more maps if I do not find something else to work on and just forget about this or keep it in the final perfect state ;-)
